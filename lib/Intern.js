// exporting the Intern subclass to be used in other files
module.exports = Intern;

// GUIDELINES
// In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, 
//`Intern` will also have the following:

// * `school`

// * `getSchool()`

// * `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Intern'`

// Finally, although itâ€™s not a requirement, consider adding validation 
//to ensure that user input is in the proper format.
